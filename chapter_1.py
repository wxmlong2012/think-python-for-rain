###  try out the following with python code:


# 1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?


# 2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?


# 3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?


# 4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 09. What happens if you try this in Python? What about 011?


# 5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?
